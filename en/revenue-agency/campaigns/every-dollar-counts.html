She has also been diagnosed with scoliosis and bilateral hearing loss. Kristin learned about the DTC from her family and the disability community. Since Kristin needs modifications to her home, vehicle, and wheelchair to live well as a person with a disability, the DTC helps her offset some of these costs.</p>
